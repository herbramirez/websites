                <p> <strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong> Interruption is a lightweight, free forming, collapsible barrier designed to disrupt and reroute commuter's daily routine.
                  Our intervention manifested as a physical cardboard barrier. It was roughly 3 feet in height and 20 (maybe) feet in length. The prototype piece collapsible, lightweight and free-forming. Our intervention was two long pieces of cardboard barriers that we put up around the subway station to change the path of commuters and to disrupt the mindless flow of transportation. </p>
                        
                 <p> <strong>IDEATION and PROTOYPING:</strong> ideation began with by exploring Astor Place and examining the flow of traffic. After scouting out Astor Place we decided to build something for the exit for the train (North Bound).  </p>
                        
                 <p> <strong>RESULTS:</strong>The cardboard could shift in direction and bend in multiple ways. The purpose of our construction was to see how the public would interact with barriers and general vague forms when they were on their way to a specific destination. The structure was put directly in the subway station entrance and people interacted with in in both an anticipatory and un-anticipatory way. The most common interaction was the lack of interaction. People respected the barriers and either avoided physical contact or left the subway station because of the barrier put in place. When someone moved it to make a clear path for themselves they created an obstacle for someone else. However, we found that through changes within the subway (a somewhat constant, but untimed gust of wind coming from the approaching trains) - the effect we intended morphed into an outright blockage in flow rather than a subtle disruption.
